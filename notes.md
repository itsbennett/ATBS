## Expressions, Data Types and Variables
- **Expressions** consist of **values** and **operators.** 
  - Expressions = Values + Operators
  - Ex: `2 + 2 = 4`

- Python follows the order of operations.
  - Ex: `2 + 3 * 6 = 20`
  - Ex: `(2 + 3) * 6 = 30`
  - A visualization tool can be found [here](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/eval/2-1.html)

- **Intergers** are also called "*ints*" and **floating points** are called "*floats*".
  - Ex: 42 is an *interger* while *42.0* is a float.

- **Variables** hold values.
  - Ex: `spam = 42`
    - Typing `spam` will print 42.
    - Once your variable has been reassigned, it will take the value last given to it.
    - This is called **overwriting** the variable.

- If a Python instruction evaluates to a single value, it's an **expression**. Otherwise, it's a **statement**.

- Recap:
  - Expressions = Values + Operators
  - Int, Float, String
  - 'Hello World'
  - spam = 42
  - spam + 1
