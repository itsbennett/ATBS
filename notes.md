# Expressions, Data Types and Variables
- **Expressions** consist of **values** and **operators.** 
  - Expressions = Values + Operators
  - Ex: `2 + 2 = 4`
- Python follows the order of operations.
  - Ex: `2 + 3 * 6 = 20`
  - Ex: `(2 + 3) * 6 = 30`
  - A visualization tool can be found [here](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/eval/2-1.html)
- **Intergers** are also called "*ints*" and **floating points** are called "*floats*".
  - Ex: 42 is an *interger* while *42.0* is a float.
